# MoreDoors

A rando 4 connection mod which adds more locked doors to Hallownest with unique keys.

Twenty-seven unique doors, each with their own unique key, are added to the game by this mod.
The keys also have vanilla locations, which can optionally be added to the locations pool.
See SPOILER.md for the full list of doors and vanilla key locations if you wish.

## Settings

* Add More Doors: Adds more doors to Hallownest if enabled
  * Doors Level: The number of doors to add
    * Some Doors: About a third of the doors are added
    * More Doors: About two-thirds of the doors are added
    * All Doors: All of the doors are added
  * Add Key Locations: Adds the vanilla key locations for the added doors to the locations pool
    * Matching Doors: Only adds the key locations for the doors that were actually added
    * All Doors: Add all key locations, even for doors that weren't added

### Interop

All key items are placed in the 'Keys' pool for randomization, and for All Major Items tracking.
If 'Duplicate Unique Keys' is set, every key gets a duplicate.
